Note [Migrating TcM Messages]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of #18516, we are slowly migrating the diagnostic messages emitted
and reported in the TcM from SDoc to TcRnMessage. Historically, GHC emitted
some diagnostics in 3 pieces, i.e. there were lots of error-reporting functions
that accepted 3 SDocs an input: one for the important part of the message,
one for the context and one for any supplementary information. Consider the following:

    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Char’
    • In the expression: x4
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: return (x2, x4)
      In the expression:

Under the hood, the reporting functions in Tc.Utils.Monad were emitting "Couldn't match"
as the important part, "In the expression" as the context and "In a stmt..In the expression"
as the supplementary, with the context and supplementary usually smashed together so that
the final message would be composed only by two SDoc (which would then be bulletted like in
the example).

In order for us to smooth out the migration to the new diagnostic infrastructure, we
introduce the 'ErrInfo' and 'TcRnMessageDetailed' types, which serve exactly the purpose
of bridging the two worlds together without breaking the external API or the existing
format of messages reported by GHC.

Using 'ErrInfo' and 'TcRnMessageDetailed' also allows us to move away from the SDoc-ridden
diagnostic API inside Tc.Utils.Monad, enabling further refactorings.

In the future, once the conversion will be complete and we will successfully eradicate
any use of SDoc in the diagnostic reporting of GHC, we can surely revisit the usage and
existence of these two types, which for now remain a "necessary evil".

  {-| TcRnInaccessibleCode is a warning that is emitted when the RHS of a pattern
      match is inaccessible, because the constraint solver has detected a contradiction.

        foo :: B False -> Bool
        foo MkFalse = False

  {-| TcRnImplicitLift is a warning (controlled with -Wimplicit-lift) that occurs when
      a Template Haskell quote implicitly uses 'lift'.

     Test cases: rename/should_compile/T7167
  -}
  TcRnDodgyImports :: RdrName -> TcRnMessage
  {-| TcRnDodgyExports is a warning (controlled by -Wdodgy-exports) that occurs when a datatype
      'T' is exported with all constructors, i.e. 'T(..)', but is it just a type synonym or a

  -}
  TcRnMissingImportList :: IE GhcPs -> TcRnMessage
  {-| When a module marked trustworthy or unsafe (using -XTrustworthy or -XUnsafe) is compiled
      with a plugin, the TcRnUnsafeDueToPlugin warning (controlled by -Wunsafe) is used as the
      reason the module was inferred to be unsafe. This warning is not raised if the

  {-| TcRnShadowedName is a warning (controlled by -Wname-shadowing) that occurs whenever
      an inner-scope value has the same name as an outer-scope value, i.e. the inner
      value shadows the outer one. This can catch typographical errors that turn into
      hard-to-find bugs. The warning is suppressed for names beginning with an underscore.

      Examples(s):
        f = ... let f = id in ... f ...  -- NOT OK, 'f' is shadowed
        f x = do { _ignore <- this; _ignore <- that; return (the other) } -- suppressed via underscore

block, which are displayed in that order, with a mark to divide them. The
the main msg ('report_important') varies depending on the error
in question, but context and relevant bindings are always the same, which
should simplify visual parsing.

{- Note [discardProvCtxtGivens]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In most situations we call all enclosing implications "useful". There is one
exception, and that is when the constraint that causes the error is from the
"provided" context of a pattern synonym declaration:

  pattern Pat :: (Num a, Eq a) => Show a   => a -> Maybe a
             --  required      => provided => type
  pattern Pat x <- (Just x, 4)

When checking the pattern RHS we must check that it does actually bind all
the claimed "provided" constraints; in this case, does the pattern (Just x, 4)
bind the (Show a) constraint.  Answer: no!

But the implication we generate for this will look like
   forall a. (Num a, Eq a) => [W] Show a
because when checking the pattern we must make the required
constraints available, since they are needed to match the pattern (in
this case the literal '4' needs (Num a, Eq a)).

BUT we don't want to suggest adding (Show a) to the "required" constraints
of the pattern synonym, thus:
  pattern Pat :: (Num a, Eq a, Show a) => Show a => a -> Maybe a
It would then typecheck but it's silly.  We want the /pattern/ to bind
the alleged "provided" constraints, Show a.

So we suppress that Implication in discardProvCtxtGivens.  It's
painfully ad-hoc but the truth is that adding it to the "required"
constraints would work.  Suppressing it solves two problems.  First,
we never tell the user that we could not deduce a "provided"
constraint from the "required" context. Second, we never give a
possible fix that suggests to add a "provided" constraint to the
"required" context.

For example, without this distinction the above code gives a bad error
message (showing both problems):

  error: Could not deduce (Show a) ... from the context: (Eq a)
         ... Possible fix: add (Show a) to the context of
         the signature for pattern synonym `Pat' ...
