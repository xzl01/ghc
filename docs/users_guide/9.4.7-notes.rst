==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

Compiler
--------

- Fix a number of scoping bugs in the specialiser, prevent simplifier
  panics (:ghc-ticket:`21391`, :ghc-ticket:`21689`, :ghc-ticket:`21828`,
  :ghc-ticket:`23762`).

Build system and packaging
--------------------------

- Allow building documentation with sphinx versions older than ``4.0`` along
  with older versions of ``python`` (:ghc-ticket:`23807`, :ghc-ticket:`23818`).

- Also build vanilla (non-static) alpine bindists (:ghc-ticket:`23349`, :ghc-ticket:`23828`).

- Make hadrian buildable with Cabal-3.8.

Core libraries
--------------

- Bump ``bytestring`` to 0.11.5.2 (:ghc-ticket:`23789`), allowing GHC to be
  bootstrapped on systems having ``HAVE_PTHREAD_CONDATTR_SETCLOCK``
