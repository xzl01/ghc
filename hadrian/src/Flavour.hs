-- * CLI and <root>/hadrian.settings options

{-
Note [Hadrian settings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hadrian lets one customize GHC builds through the UserSettings module,
where Hadrian users can override existing 'Flavour's or create entirely
new ones, overriding/extending the options passed to some builder
building the RTS in more ways and much more.

It now also offers a more "old-school" interface, in the form of
@foo.bar.baz = v@ or @foo.bar.baz += v@ expressions, that one can
pass on the command line that invokes hadrian:

> $ hadrian/build --flavour=quickest -j "stage1.ghc-bin.ghc.link.opts += -v3"

or in a file at <build root>/hadrian.settings, where <build root>
is the build root to be used for the build, which is _build by default.
For example, you could create a file at _build/hadrian.settings with the
following contents:

> stage1.ghc-bin.ghc.link.opts += -v3
> stage1.base.ghc.hs.opts += -ddump-timings

and issue:

> $ hadrian/build

Hadrian would pick up the settings given in _build/hadrian.settings (as well as
any settings that you may additionally be passing on the command line) and
update the relevant flavour accordingly, to issue the additional arguments
specified by the user.

The supported settings are described by 'builderSetting' below, using
operations from Applicative + two new primitives, 'matchString' and
'matchOneOf', that come as members of the 'Match' class. This gives us
a simple but powerful vocabulary to describe settings and parse them
into values that we can use to compute interesting things, like a 'Predicate'
that we can use to emit additional arguments, or a list of possible completions.

> fmap, (<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
> pure :: Applicative f => a -> f a
> (<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
> (*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b
> (<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
> (<$) :: Functor f => a -> f b -> f a
>
> str :: Match f => String -> f ()
> val :: Match f => String -> a -> f a
> oneOf :: Match f => [f a] -> f a
> choose :: Match f => [(String, a)] -> f a
> wild :: Match f => [(String, a)] -> f (Wildcard a)

For instance, to describe possible settings:
  foo.bar.{x, y}
  foo.baz.{a, b}.c

we could write:

> str "foo" *> oneOf [ str "bar" *> choose [ ("x", "x"), ("y", "y") ]
>                    , str "baz" *> choose [ ("a", "ac"), ("b", "bc") <* str "c" ]
>                    ]

'builderSetting' uses these combinators to describe the setting keys that
Hadrian supports. A user-oriented description of this mechanism is available
in hadrian/doc/user-settings.md.
